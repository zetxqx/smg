"""Tests for gateway worker management APIs.

Tests the gateway's worker management endpoints:
- GET /workers - List all workers
- POST /add_worker - Add a worker dynamically
- POST /remove_worker - Remove a worker dynamically
- GET /v1/models - List available models

Usage:
    pytest e2e_test/router/test_worker_api.py -v
